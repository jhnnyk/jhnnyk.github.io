title: 100 Mountains in 2016
---

My friends inspire me. Their goals and acheivements stretch my perception of what is possible. Accomplishments that I would not have thought possible are checked off lists.

It's inspired me to stretch myself. So among a few other goals for 2016, I'm striving to summit 100 different peaks this year. They can be mountains I've climbed in prior years, but I'll only be counting each mountain once in 2016 -- and yes, only officially ranked peaks with 300' of prominence. I'll track them using the list below and update this post throughout the year.
