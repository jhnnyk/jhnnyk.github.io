title: Staunton State Park - Lions Head
---

This morning was my first time out in Staunton State Park and I was shocked at how gorgeous this place is. For a nice as it is it certainly seems to fly under the radar.

I didn't have a ton of time so I shot right up Lions Head the shortest way possible which still made for a 10.5 mile run with ~2,000ft of vert.
