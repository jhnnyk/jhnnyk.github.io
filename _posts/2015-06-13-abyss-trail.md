title: Abyss Trail (lower half) - Mt. Evans Wilderness

The lower half of the Abyss Trail is a wonderful gentle climb mostly along the Scott Gomer Creek. Like many trails the higher you go the better it gets and after a couple stream crossings opens up into beautiful meadows with gorgeous views. The first stream crossing has a couple well cut and placed logs. The second crossing had no bridge at all which meant a thigh deep crossing in painfully cold icy water. And the third crossing was a fairly precarious log bridge, but after the previous icy dip, I was thankful there was anything there at all.

Between tapering and time constraints, I only got about 5 miles up where the Abyss trail crosses the Rosalie trail. Nonetheless this section is lovely and well worth the short trip up Guanella Pass.
